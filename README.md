# classification-of-musical-metre-with-DNN
By DNN(Deep Neural Networks), we focus on the classification project of musical metre. Specially, we discuss the 4 main type metres (2/4 3/4 4/4 6/8).
Firstly, we use matlab not only to calculate autocorrelation of constant, duration and melodic but also get phrases' parameter by LBDM model.
After using matlab for creating data matrix and target matrix, we can choose different k_fold_value to decide the number of testing and training data.
